# Overview

To predict loan risk for Alphabet Soup, Machine Learning and Neural Networks are used to analyze a dataset of more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Classifiers based on neural network models have been developed and evaluated.

# Summary

Pre-processing of the input dataset was successfully carried out. The neural network model was successfully compiled and regressed. However, the model performance only achieved barly 72% accuracy even upon changing the hyperparameters, such as activation function, number of layers and number of neurons. It is possible that the lack of accuracy is due to missing essential variables in the input dataset. It might be a good idea to discuss with loan experts and make sure to include all the essential variables.
