# Overview

To predict loan risk for Alphabet Soup, Machine Learning and Neural Networks are used to analyze a dataset of more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Classifiers based on neural network models have been developed and evaluated.

# Results



# Summary

Pre-processing of the input dataset was successfully carried out. The neural network model was successfully compiled and regressed. However, the model performance only achieved barly 72% accuracy even upon changing the hyperparameters, such as activation function, number of layers and number of neurons.
The model ended up with the accuracy score of 59% after optimization. The initial neural network had a accuracy score of 72%. This loss in accuracy can be explained from the fact that the model overfitted. Furthermore, we could further also optimize our neural network by removing more features or simply adding more data to the dataset to increase accuracy. Since our accuracy score was not particularly up to the standard with neural networks, we could have used the Random Forest classifiers. This is because random forest is a robust and accurate model due to their sufficient number of estimators and tree depth. Also the random forest models have a faster performance than neural networks and could have avoided the data from being overfitted.
